### Goal

xShare envisions everyone **sharing their health data in European Electronic Health Record Exchange Format (EEHRxF) with a click-of-a-button** – the xShare or yellow button- to be featured across health portals and patient apps, allowing people to exercise their data portability rights under GDPR.

More contextual information about the Yellow Button can be found [here](https://xshare-project.eu/the-xshare-button/)

### Overview

The yellow button enables natural persons to share their health data in European Electronic Health Record Exchange Format (EEHRxF) by offering three main capabilities:
* [download](#download) your health data
* share health data by using a [one-time link](#one-time-share)
* share health data by using a [link valid for a period of time](#linked-options)

**Note: a product implementing the Yellow Button is not required to support all of the listed features**


### Key Features

#### Common (pre-requisites)

To use the yellow button, natural persons shall be allowed to satisfy these pre-conditions:
* The natural person has an account and health data in the health provider or third-party app.
* The natural person is authenticated in the health provider portal/app.
* The HIS of the health provider or the third-party app is able to export and import health information in EEHRxF or in a non-EEHRxF format accompanied with a clear specification or implementation guide.

### How to label your product

The process begins when an organisation needs to certify their health system with the EEHRxF. This step involves the initiation of a formal certification process aimed at ensuring that health systems or applications adhere to the standards and policies defined within the European Electronic Health Record Exchange Format (EEHRxF). At this stage, a decision arises, posing the question: "What is the level of certification needed?" The applicant must decide between two available paths based on the desired rigor of the certification: Self-assessment (bronze level) or third-party evaluation (silver and gold).

Details of this are provided in the [xShare Button Labeling process](labeling_process.html) page.
