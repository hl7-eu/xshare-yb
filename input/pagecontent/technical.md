The **technology** domain describes the technology stack and the infrastructure required to support the xShare Yellow Button.

<div style="text-align: center">
{% include bdat-t.svg %}
</div>

This includes:
* technical standards, specifications, and security considerations.
* tools that can be used for realizing the [Primary logical application components](yb_components.html) of the xShare reference implementation. (See [xShare Yellow Button Toolbox](yb_tools.html))

### Overview

Technical standards, specifications, and security considerations are documented in this version of the guide by starting from a sequence diagram (diagram below) representing how the [application view sequence](application.html) is implemented.

The diagram highlights (in yellow) the roles (i.e. the participants) that Yellow Button implementers can claim conformance to:

* The *xShare Yellow Button Provider*. It implements the [xShare Yellow Button](application.html#the-yellow-button-participants) application role.
* The *xShare Yellow Button Consumer*.  It implements the [Authorised Data Recipient](application.html#the-yellow-button-participants) application role.

More details about these roles (actors in the IHE world) are documented in the [xShare Yellow Button Participants](actors.html) page.

Messages supported by these roles (transactions in the IHE world) are reported in the [xShare Yellow Button Messages](#xshare-yellow-button-messages) section.

By clicking on the message in the diagrams readers can directly access the details of that message, including conformance rules.

**The messages for which technical validation is supposed to be performed are higlighted in blue.**

A SMART Health Link may be configured either as a short-lived sharing mechanism or, by using the L flag, as a long-term link whose manifest content may evolve over time. The L flag does not by itself define the expiry period; expiration can be indicated using exp, while actual link validity is enforced by the SHL Sharing Application / Resource Server.

##### Conformance

* Yellow button adopters implementing *Generate SHL URI* shall act as [xShare Yellow Button Link Provider](actors.html#xshare-yellow-button-link-provider)

* The SMART Health Link URI is generated in conformance with the [SMART Health Links Sharing Application Generates a SMART Health Link URI](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/smart-health-cards-and-links/links-specification.html#smart-health-links-sharing-application-generates-a-smart-health-link-uri) specifications.


#### Process SHL URI

The xShare Yellow Button Provider process a SMART Health Link URI.

##### Conformance

* Yellow button adopters implementing *Process SHL URI* shall act as [xShare Yellow Button Link Consumer](actors.html#xshare-yellow-button-link-consumer)

* The SMART Health Link URI is processed in conformance with the [SMART Health Links Receiving Application processes a SMART Health Link](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/smart-health-cards-and-links/links-specification.html#smart-health-links-receiving-application-processes-a-smart-health-link) specifications.


#### Request SHL Manifest
